# Code Health Audit

## Overview
This audit reviews the current state of the ConnectingHands codebase, focusing on code health, security, maintainability, and best practices. The findings and recommendations below are intended to guide future improvements and refactoring efforts.

---

## 1. Service Layer Complexity
**Findings:**
- Several service implementations (e.g., `DonationServiceImpl`, `ResourceRequestServiceImpl`, `ResourceServiceImpl`, `OrphanageServiceImpl`) contain long, repetitive update methods with many consecutive `if` statements and similar validation logic.
- Code duplication and lack of helper methods make maintenance harder.

**Recommendations:**
- Refactor update methods using helper functions for field updates and validation (as demonstrated in the refactored `updateOrphanage`).
- Centralize common validation and update logic to reduce code duplication.

---

## 2. Security Implementation
**Findings:**
- `SecurityServiceImpl` contains `TODO` comments for critical security context logic, indicating incomplete implementation.
- Some exception handling in security-related classes was previously silent or generic.

**Recommendations:**
- Complete the implementation of user and role checks in `SecurityServiceImpl` using Spring Security context.
- Ensure all exceptions in security filters and aspects are logged and handled appropriately.

---

## 3. Exception Handling Consistency
**Findings:**
- Generic exceptions (`IllegalArgumentException`, etc.) were used in several places.
- Custom exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `ValidationException`, etc.) are present but not used consistently.

**Recommendations:**
- Use custom exceptions throughout the service and controller layers for clarity and better error handling.
- Ensure all exceptions are logged with context, especially in security and audit-related code.

---

## 4. Input Validation
**Findings:**
- Input validation is not always enforced at the DTO or service level.
- Potential for invalid or malicious data to reach business logic.

**Recommendations:**
- Add validation annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`) to DTOs.
- Add explicit validation checks in service methods for critical business rules.

---

## 5. Test Coverage
**Findings:**
- Test classes exist for controllers and services, but coverage of edge cases and new/refactored logic is unclear.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand unit and integration tests, especially for update methods, security checks, and exception handling.
- Ensure all new and refactored code is covered by tests.

---

## 6. Logging and Auditing
**Findings:**
- Logging was previously missing or commented out in some security and audit-related code.
- Audit logging is present but could be improved for error context and null safety.

**Recommendations:**
- Use SLF4J for logging in all critical classes.
- Ensure all exceptions and critical actions are logged with context.
- Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens).
