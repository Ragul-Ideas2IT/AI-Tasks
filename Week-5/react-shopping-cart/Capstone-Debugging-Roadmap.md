# Capstone Debugging Roadmap: React Shopping Cart

## Overview
This roadmap provides a comprehensive, systematic 7-day plan to debug, optimize, and prepare the `react-shopping-cart` codebase for production. It covers bug categories, priority assessment, daily strategies, and actionable steps.

---

## Bug Categories
1. **React anti-patterns and state management issues**
2. **Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities**
3. **Error handling gaps and edge cases**
4. **Security vulnerabilities**
5. **Code quality and maintainability issues**

---

## Priority Assessment
- **Critical:** Bugs that break functionality, security vulnerabilities
- **High-impact:** Performance issues, error handling gaps
- **Medium:** User experience problems, code quality

# üó∫Ô∏è 7-Day Debugging Roadmap

## Day 1: Codebase Audit & Prioritization
- Familiarize with codebase structure and main flows
- Run the app and perform exploratory testing
- Review code reviews, issues, and test coverage
- Categorize and prioritize bugs
- Deliverable: Bug tracker with categories and priorities

## Day 2: React Anti-Patterns & State Management
- Identify direct state mutation, prop mutation, overuse of context, unnecessary re-renders
- Use ESLint, React DevTools
- Refactor to immutable patterns, use hooks wisely
- Add/expand unit tests for state logic
- Deliverable: Refactored state logic, regression tests

## Day 3: Performance Bottlenecks & Optimization
- Profile with React DevTools Profiler
- Memoize expensive computations/components
- Optimize list rendering (pagination, virtualization)
- Debounce/throttle user input handlers
- Deliverable: Measured and improved render times, performance tests

## Day 4: Error Handling Gaps & Edge Cases
- Add try-catch to async logic
- Validate API responses and user inputs
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Add error boundaries
- Deliverable: Robust error handling, error state tests

## Day 5: Security Vulnerabilities
- Sanitize all HTML (DOMPurify or similar)
- Validate all user input and API data
- Restrict image sources and navigation targets
- Review for open redirects
- Deliverable: Hardened security, security-focused tests

## Day 6: Code Quality & Maintainability
- Refactor large components, DRY up logic
- Improve naming, add comments, update docs
- Ensure consistent code style (Prettier, ESLint)
- Deliverable: Clean, maintainable code, improved docs

## Day 7: Production Readiness & Monitoring
- Add runtime monitoring (Sentry, analytics)
- Set up logging for critical actions/errors
- Review/update deployment scripts and README
- Final regression and user acceptance testing
- Deliverable: Monitored, documented, production-ready app

---

## Core Bug Fixes
- Refactor state updates to use immutable patterns
- Memoize expensive computations/components
- Optimize list rendering and avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Advanced Debugging
- Add robust error handling and user feedback
- Sanitize and validate all user input and API data
- Add error boundaries and security-focused tests

## Production Readiness
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Update documentation and deployment scripts
- Ensure all tests pass and code is clean

## Summary Table
| Category                | Priority         | Example Fixes/Actions                        |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| State Management        | Critical         | Immutable updates, avoid prop mutation       |
| Performance             | High             | Memoization, optimize lists, profile renders |
| Error Handling          | High             | try-catch, user feedback, error boundaries   |
| Security                | Critical         | Sanitize HTML, validate input, safe URLs     |
| Code Quality            | Medium           | Refactor, DRY, comments, docs                |
| Monitoring/Production   | High             | Sentry, logging, deployment scripts          |

---

## Monitoring & Prevention
- Use Sentry or similar for error monitoring
- Set up CI/CD with automated tests and linting
- Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Document all fixes and changes for future maintainers
